# Telecom-Churn-Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry. Customer churn is a critical business metric, and understanding its underlying factors is essential for telecom companies to make informed decisions and reduce attrition.

In this project, we will explore a dataset containing telecom customer information and churn data. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover insights that can help identify patterns, predictors, and potential strategies to mitigate churn.

## Introduction

Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a product or service within a specific time period. High churn rates can be costly for telecom companies, as they may lose valuable customers and revenue. The goal of this EDA project is to gain insights into why customers churn and what actions can be taken to retain them.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (e.g., Male, Female).
- **SeniorCitizen**: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1) or not (0).
- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No).
- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No).
- **Tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
- **PhoneService**: Whether the customer has a phone service (Yes/No).
- **MultipleLines**: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes/No).
- **InternetService**: Type of internet service (e.g., DSL, Fiber optic).
- **OnlineSecurity**: Whether the customer has online security (Yes/No/No internet service).
- **OnlineBackup**: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes/No/No internet service).
- **DeviceProtection**: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes/No/No internet service).
- **TechSupport**: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes/No/No internet service).
- **StreamingTV**: Whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes/No/No internet service).
- **StreamingMovies**: Whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes/No/No internet service).
- **Contract**: Type of contract (e.g., Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
- **PaperlessBilling**: Whether the customer uses paperless billing (Yes/No).
- **PaymentMethod**: Payment method used by the customer (e.g., Electronic check, Mailed check).
- **MonthlyCharges**: The monthly charges for the service.
- **TotalCharges**: The total charges the customer has paid.
- **Churn**: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we will perform a thorough exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Our analysis will include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Summary statistics and data visualization.
- Distribution of churn vs. non-churn customers.
- Correlation analysis to identify influential factors.

## Key Findings

Based on our EDA, we will highlight the key findings and insights obtained from the analysis. These findings may include:

Factors that strongly correlate with churn.
Demographic trends related to churn.
Customer behaviour patterns affect churn.


## Conclusion

In the conclusion section, we will summarize the main takeaways from the EDA and provide recommendations for telecom companies to reduce customer churn.
